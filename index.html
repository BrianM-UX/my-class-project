                    I am a <span>Responsive Designer & Developer</span> who thrives on visual storytelling and the best user experience.
                    When I'm not working, pursuing side projects or getting lost in the rabbit hole of blogs and books, I can be found 
                    traveling, hiking and searching for new stories.

                        I was born in Austell Georgia after my parents moved down from South Carolina. My parents were both used to the slower
                        pace of country living but adapted to the metropolitan Atlanta area very well.

                        My passion: I'm a bona fide nerd. I have a deep passion for gaming, reading, and learning overall. I also love to be 
                        active. Tae Kwon Do and Jiu Jitsu along with hiking and extreme sports always get my blood pumping. And of course, I 
                        can't forget to say that I love to try new foods.

                        A fun fact: I never learned to dance before getting married, so, for our one year anniversary my wife and I took up 
                        ballroom dancing lessons. So far we've done waltz, swing, and samba!
